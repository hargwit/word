# Word - [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hargwit/word.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hargwit/word) [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ab169658-1ac4-44cd-a5dd-17bf62dfb794/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/word/deploys)

An app built in `React.js` using test driven development.

## How to play

The aim of the game is to guess the other player's word first.

Each player chooses a 4 letter word. This word may not have any duplicated
letters (eg. word is valid, wood is not).

Players then take it in turn to guess other 4 letter words.

For each guess the other player will say how many letters the guess and their
word have in common.

The winner is the first person to guess the correct word.

## The project

This project is the basis of a number of blog posts exploring test driven
development techniques in `React.js` on my site
